Subject of this FS98 model is an RA5-C Vigilante in service with US Navy's Heavy Reconnaissance Attack Training Squadron RVAH-5 'Savage Sons' when serving aboard USS Constellation in the Vietnam area in 1968/69.For most of their operational lives the Vigilantes served in the finish depicted here.

It features:
retracting gear,
all moving tailplane end vertical stabilizer as in the real thing,
spoiler deflectors which act as ailerons,
arresting hook and spoiler, (with / key)
transparent cockpit canopy with pilot inside.

The aircraft.

The RA5C Vigilante two-seat shipboard reconnaissance and attack aircraft was flown for the first time on June 30,1962 and is one of the two growth versions of the A-5A, the other, the A-5B being intended primarily for the attack role but progressing no further than the prototype stage. The RA-5C is essentially a reconnaissance aircraft but retains attack capability, and changes from the A-5A include extension of flap surfaces, both spanwise and chordwise, modification of the boundary layer control system ,and an aerodynamically faired hump aft of the raised bombardier-navigator cockpit, this hump housing additional fuel.The RA-5C retain the bombing-navigation system and is simiraly powered to the A-5A, but carries an extremely reconnaissance system. The RA-5C entered service with RVAH-5 in 1964.
